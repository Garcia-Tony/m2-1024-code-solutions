## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Why do we use databases in Web development?
  Applications are typically backed by some form of data store. It is possible for data to be stored directly in files that are managed by the application, but when the application needs to quickly retrieve or store complex data in an organized fashion, a database fills that need nicely.

- What is PostgreSQL and what are some alternative relational databases?
  PostgreSQL is a powerful, free, open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Alternative databases are MySQL, SQL Server by Microsoft, and Oracle by Oracle Corporation.

- What are some advantages of learning a relational database?
  Relational databases are commonly referred to as "SQL databases" because you usually do work with them using some variation of the SQL language. If you are storing related data, then a relational database is probably a good first choice. A quality of many relational databases is that they support good guarantees about data integrity.

- What is one way to see if PostgreSQL is running?
  sudo service postgresql status
