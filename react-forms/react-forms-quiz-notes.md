## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- How do controlled components differ from uncontrolled components?
  Controlled and uncontrolled components differ primarily in how they manage and handle form data in React. In controlled, the form data is stored in React state. In uncontrolled, the form data is handled by the DOM itself, not React state.

- What are some advantages of using uncontrolled components?
  Uncontrolled components don't require you to maintain form input values in React's state, so they are simpler to set up for basic forms.

- What are some advantages of using controlled components?
  Controlled components give you full control over form inputs, allowing you to immediately access, manipulate, and validate the data as the user types.

- Which style do you prefer?
  I like controlled better, it feels more natural.

- What two props must you pass to an input for it to be "controlled"?
  Value and onChange

- What are some popular npm packages for creating forms in React?
  React Hook Form, Formik, and React Final Form
